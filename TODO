the Paris Diplodocus has not been updated at all since the original 1908 mounting.

Confirmation: It has never moved since 1908, not even during WWI and WWII !

In 1956 we received:
[...]
Diplodocus- 6 proximal caudals, complete femur, most of other femur (CM 94), CMNH 10671. This specimen was also sold to Houston.

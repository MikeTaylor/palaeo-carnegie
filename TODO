DONE	Here's the thought that haunts me: in my never-published 4th dissertation chapter, I used the femur length of D. carnegie along with the cervical and dorsal lengths to do stats. I wonder how many other people have done the same, not realizing to what extent that skeleton is a chimaera. That will be a very good point to make in your paper on that mount, and you are welcome to use my diss. as evidence of people misusing measurements of that skeleton because they didn't know the complexities of its origin(s).

NO	Read "Discovering dinosaurs in the Old West: the field journals of Arthur Lakes" at https://archive.org/details/discoveringdinos0000lake/mode/2up
NO	BTW, Hatcher (1904:47) gives the measurements of two femora: the right of 84, and the left of 94. The ratios between their measurements are 1.05 (length), 1.28 (proximal breadth) and 1.13 (distal breadth). So not only is CM 84 5% larger using the standard femur-length criterion, it's also significantly more robust.

the Paris Diplodocus has not been updated at all since the original 1908 mounting.
[...]
Confirmation: It has never moved since 1908, not even during WWI and WWII !

In 1956 we received:
[...]
Diplodocus- 6 proximal caudals, complete femur, most of other femur (CM 94), CMNH 10671. This specimen was also sold to Houston.

> Ah, of course! Do we know to what extent the Carnegie technicians learned from the experience of the Bernissart cast-makers?

Can’t prove it, but my educated guess is: not a thing. The Brussels crowd maintained little to no contact outside the francophone world, and was even a bit paranoid about others finding out their “secrets”.

The diplodocine specimen initially designated CM 662 was moved to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in November 1956, because museum director Graham Netting had directed head of vertebrate paleontology J. LeRoy Kay to trade large dinosaur specimens due to lack of storage space. It was there given the specimen number CMNH 10670. In 1963, however, the specimen was sold for $15,000 to the Houston Museum of Natural History, where it was catalogued as HMNS 175. (The CMNH’s Haplocanthosaurus was excavated between 1954 and 1957 (McIntosh and Williams 1998:4–5) and it is possible that the Diplodocus CMNH 10670 was moved on because it became apparent that there was not enough space to mount two large sauropods.] The Houston museum mounted the skeleton in 1975 — ironically filling it out with elements cast from the original Carnegie molds, which they had by then acquired (Taylor and Sroka, in prep.) — then restored and remounted it between 2013 and 2015. For simplicity we refer to this specimen throughout by its original designation CM 662, as it was under this specimen number that most of its role in this story was played out.

Happily, I still have a copy of the ‘advisory document’ that I sent to the firm who remounted our D. carnegii skeleton (CM 84/CM 94/CM 307), Phil Fraley Productions, in 2006. Therein, I write (emphasis mine, today):

“The forefeet currently used on the Diplodocus carnegii mount are casts of those of ?D. hayi and are consequently too small. Moreover, their morphology apparently differs significantly from that of a forefoot from Thermopolis, WY referred to D. carnegii by Bedell and Trexler (2005). We might consider acquiring a cast of the Thermopolis specimen, to serve as a model for sculpting more accurate forefeet for the D. carnegii mount.”

As you noted in the remainder of your excerpt, that is indeed what came to pass.

## My own comments (to be integrated)

XXX headings. Make ToC

XXX underlinings

XXX URLs

XXX Figures far from where they are referenced, e.g. Figure 10 (page 14) is references on page 10.

**Page 1, header**<br />
"VOL 91, NUMBER1" has no space after "NUMBER".

**Page 1, Key Words**<br />
A completely new set of keywords has been provided (Ecology, life history, predation, reproduction), none of which is relevant to the content of the paper. Perhaps a template set of keywords were accidentally included? Please reinstate the key words from the submitted manuscript (cast, Carnegie Museum, dinosaur, history, sauropod, skeletal mount).

p2f1
"at Carnegie Museum": insert "the".

p2c1p2
After "contributes most of the original fossil material to the mount", replace the comma with a semicolon.

p2c2p1

New paragraph for "At any rate".

p8c2p2
From "To produce the plaster dinosaurs" to "were then added to the bones" (the end of the paragraph) is an extended quote from Seneff 1947, and must be typographically distinguished. In the manuscript as submitted, we used indentation, but if the journal has a different typographical convention, that's fine.

p12c2p2
From "It would be just as wise" (the start of the paragraph) to "from your mind" (near the top of the next page) is an extended quote from Holland's letter, and must be typographically distinguished. In the manuscript as submitted, we used indentation, but if the journal has a different typographical convention, that's fine.

p12c2p1
"at 12% as much": delete "at".

p16c2p3
From the heading "_Diplodocus carnegii_ Hatcher, 1901" to "partial pes CM 33985" (first paragraph of the next page) is an extended quote from McIntosh 1981, and must be typographically distinguished. In the manuscript as submitted, we used indentation, but if the journal has a different typographical convention, that's fine.

p17c1p2
"the right “tibia-fibula-pes” of the mounted skeleton was furnished from CM 94,". The final comma should be a period.

p17c2p2
"chevrons, and left ilium, femur". Delete "and".

Append the date "2007" in each cell.

p24c2p2
New paragraph for "Enquiries were made about".

From "The beast turns out to be" to "putting on this long tail" (end of the paragraph, at the top of column 2) is an extended quote from Holland 1904b, and must be typographically distinguished. In the manuscript as submitted, we used indentation, but if the journal has a different typographical convention, that's fine.

p33c1p3
"in the early to mid 2010s (Fig. 22)": replace "22" with "22a".

p33c1p4
New paragraph for "Additional posterior caudals". (This list would be clearer formatted as a bullet list, as in the submitted manuscript, but if the journal formal insist that bullets not be used, that at least separate paragraphs are necessary.)

**Page 34, table row 2 (Holland 1904a), column 3 (Length (m)).**<br />
Change "21.3" to "23.8".

**Page 34, table row 4 (Holland 1904b), column 3 (Length (m)).**<br />
Change "21.3" to "23.8".

**Page 34, table row 7 (Seneff 1947), column 3 (Length (m)).**<br />
Change "23.77" to "23.8" (since we are otherwise converting only with precision of 0.1 of a meter).

p35c1p1
"Now, six years on". Sadly, "six" must now become "eight"!

p25c1p3
After "photographs of caudals from the original mount", append "(Fig. 19)".

p25c1p3
New paragraph for "We thank Ken Carpenter".

**Pages 35ff**<br />
In all the references, the URLs have been removed. I think this must have been a poorly calibrated automatic process, as it has left us with silly references like "Dystylosaurus reminds you to beware of taking measurements from casts. Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week, 4 November 2019. — , archived at ", where both the original URL and the archived URL are absent, but the "archived at phrase" has remained. these URLs are crucial parts of the references, and must be reinstated.

**Pages 35ff**<br />
In many cases, multiple references have been concatented together into one. For example, the penultimate paragraph of the whole paper conjoins the references for Wedel 2009, Wedel 2019, and Wilhite 2003.

Because of the systemic problems affecting the references, I have not yet made a serious effort at proofing them. When we get the next round of proofs, I will read them properly.

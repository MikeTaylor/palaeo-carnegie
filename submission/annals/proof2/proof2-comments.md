# Comments on 2nd proof of Taylor et al. on Diplodocus


## Overview

Thank you so much for this second, and much better, proof. Most of the issues raised in response to the first proof have been addressed. A small number remain, and a few new problems have been introduced.


## Systemic issues

Regarding the systemic issues discussed in the previous round:

**First**,
the heading levels are now readily distingishable and almost all correct. The sole exception is on page 20, 1st column, paragraph 3, where "Replacement of skull with replica of CM 11161" should be a third-level heading and instead appears as regular text.

**Secondly**,
all four of the extended quotes are now correctly indented as requested. Unfortunately, as a side-effect, three further passages have also been indented -- incorrectly. These are:

* **Page 15, second column, paragraphs 3-4.**
"The posterior portion was sculpted based on material from CM 662
[...]
that both fossils on which the Carnegie mount’s skull were based are now considered to belong to that genus rather than to _Diplodocus_."

* **Page 23, second column, paragraph 3 to page 24, second column, paragraph 1.**
"The Smithsonian (National Museum of Natural History) has a fine partial skeleton
[...]
the forelimbs of DMNS 1494 were casts of the Carnegie’s original, incorrect forelimb material!"

* **Page 33, first column, paragraphs 4-6.**
"Additional posterior caudals inserted in the remount.
[...]
which could reasonably approach 43 cm (e.g., 1 cm additional space between each of the 15 cervicals and 28 anterior caudals)."

These sections should be rendered as normal body text.

**Thirdly**,
it's such a relief to see all the URLs reinstated: the one in the body text, but much more importantly, the many in the bibliography. Thank you.

However -- you knew there would be a "however", didn't you? -- when the URLs extend across more than one printed line (which they almost all do), clicking on the link in a PDF viewer tries to navigate to a truncated version of the link which contains only the characters on the first line. For example, consider the fourth reference:

> Anonymous. 1907. A Diplodocus for Frankfurt Museum. American
> Museum Journal, 7:98–100. https://digitallibrary.amnh.org/han-
> dle/2246/6331

Clicking this takes the user to https://digitallibrary.amnh.org/han- -- which, of course, does not resolve. If it's easy to fix these, it would be worthwhile, I think. On the other hand, as currently laid out, the links are present in the printed version, and an enterprising reader can figure out how to fix the broken links. So if this would be onerous to address, you should feel free to leave it.

**Fourth**,
it's nice to see that some of the illustrations have now been moved to appear closer to their point of reference.


## Specific issues

These have nearly all be fixed, thank you. Remaining issues:

**Page 1, header**<br />
"VOL 91, NUMBER1" still has no space after "NUMBER".

**Page 21, table rows 7, 8 and 9 (caudals), column 3 (Changes to mount).**<br />
The date "2007" has been appended in each cell as we requested, but there should be a comma before these newly added dates, as in the other cells.

**Page 21, table row 23 (Forefeet), column 3 (Changes to mount).**<br />
We ask to replace the text with "CM 662 (S), 1999; replaced again by WDC-FS001A (S), 2007".
This has been partially done, but the first date has been omitted, and the second parenthesized rather than separated from the rest of the text by a comma.


## References

I tested all the links in the references, gluing together the starts and ends of the URLs where necessary. They almost all worked as expected. This is welcome news (though of course it would be even better if you could just click the links rather than laboriously copying them, fixing up the end-of-line breaks, and pasting them into a web-browser.)

Infuriatingly, though, http://digitalcollections.powerlibrary.org seems to have broken all its links. (So many times I have seen "proper" institutions lose content, while my 17-year-old blog continues to be reliable. I made copies of all the blog posts we cited on archive.org to reassure reviewers they would still be available in the future, but it never occurred to me to do that with professionally maintained archives. There is probably a lesson there somewhere, but heck if I know what it is.) I think all we can do is leave the links in and hope that the outage is temporary.

In the Lindsay 1992 reference's title, _Barosaurus_ should be italicized.

In the Taylor 2024 reference (Atlantal ribs of the Carnegie Diplodocus, Moscow and Vienna casts) there are no spaces around the em-dash separating the doi and the link.

Everything else looks good to me!

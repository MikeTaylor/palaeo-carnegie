Mike,

I have received positive reviews from two reviewers, both calling for minor revisions. For reviewer 1 there is our review form and some comments in the ms; for reviewer 2 there are only comments in the ms. If you have any questions, please contact me.

Make sure that we have final high resolution versions of your figures when you return your revisions.

John

Sure re pers comm.

I like the trilemma term. And, if a quarry map exists showing they are one
individual we do indeed have a tail doesn’t match the neck scenario.  I am
positive the tail is not the same animal as YPM 429 or AMNH 6341 or the U
of U one. It looks like the standard Diplo tail one finds all over the
Morrison. Big, deep excavations, deeply bifurcate spines, different neural
spine build.  Ray is coming over in June to look at the limb material and
see where it falls on his limb ratio database.

Unless someone added it to a matrix somewhere that I missed none of the new
ones are in the literature. The Tucson specimen seems to be ending up in a
musuem. Larson wants to sell his to a museum. The China specimen will be
available however way easier to have studied it when they were on the
ground. I am so mad at myself for missing them by hours :-/. I have some
general shots of their left side but only got those because I talked Brock
into coming down and opening his place up at 8 pm on a week night. BYU
scanned the most proximal 3 but had technical difficulties. Ugh they were
beautiful and not restored, DNM style pristine.

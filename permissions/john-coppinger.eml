Hi Mike,

Here's a timeline and some more details, mined from my 1993 diary:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diplodocus Vertebrae - Mould & Cast 21

NHM Contacts:  Dr. Angela Milner & Nick Harding
25th Jan. 1993 - Order for Diplodocus Tail vertebrae

25th Feb. to 1st March 1993
Patch and repair 19 vertebrae

2nd to 31st March 1993
Silicone rubber moulds + GRP jackets for 21 vertebrae
Two or three piece moulds + flexible resin jackets

1st April to 6th April 1993
Casting chevrons - Flexible resin

7th April to 27th April 1993
Opening vertebrae moulds and casting in GRP
'Aerocell' filler + Glass cloth

28th April to 3rd May 1993
Tail tip moulded
Vertebrae cleaned & finished + fittings

5th & 6th May 1993
Vertebrae casts to NHM - Nick Harding
Main vertebrae cut & installed

7th May to 9th May 1993
Shaping armature & Casting tail tip

10th to 12th May 1993
Moulds to NHM Paleo
Tail tip & chevrons installed
------------------------------------------------------------------------

My main contact at the NHM was Dr. Angela Milner, of fond memory.
Angela and I viewed the skeleton in the main hall and she pointed out 
how the tail was essentially broken, with the articular processes too 
far apart, and delicately suggested the animal would not have been able 
to pass any motions!

Once we received the plaster vertebrae and chevrons at my workshop in 
Amersham I began to repair and seal them in preparation for moulding and 
casting, assisted by mould-maker William Lane.

We kept to relatively simple two or three piece moulds, to reduce 
'flash' lines, and used polyester resin mixed with 'Aerocell' filler 
(glass microspheres) for the complex lateral & spinous processes.
This mix was both lightweight, sufficiently rigid and removed the need 
to 'lay-up' those processes internally.  Each centrum was reinforced 
with GRP and woven glass cloth for strength where each verbrae would 
slide onto the supporting steel armature.
Colouring the resin gel coat to match the original plaster's 
'grey/black' colour was critical.

With 21 moulds to make we set up a long 'assembly line' of tables and 
worked on at least five vertebrae at any one time to speed up each 
process.  Working fast along a line of moulds caused the only really 
anxious moment:

On several moulds the silicone rubber had set but was still curing when 
the outer fibreglass jackets were laid on.
So, hot days and hot resin - When we opened those moulds the silicone 
didn't easily separate from the fibreglass and the original plaster was, 
as I'd predicted, largely destroyed.
I did briefly contemplate calling Pittsburgh and asking if they still 
had their original moulds - - - !
In practice some careful prying with scalpels saved the day.

The only other real problem was the tail tip, the final series of 
tubular vertebrae.  This was moulded and cast as a single piece of 
fibreglass, reinforced with carbon fibre, that would plug into the 
tubular steel armature.
I'd estimated how far the double curve would sag but the first cast 
bowed too far down under its own weight.  The only solution was to 
re-cast it with a much higher initial curve.

I think that's it for now, but if anything else returns to memory I'll 
pass it on.
And please ask any other questions you might have - - -

All the Best, and Best Wishes for your project,
John

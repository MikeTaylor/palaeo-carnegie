Hi Mike,



It was really good to see you this week. Here is some info about John
Coppinger, the sculptor who used to work at the NHM in the special
effects/engineering department and not only ended up making Jabba the Hutt
etc but played some characters in the Star Wars prequels too (as well as
working on the London Diplodocus):



From Wookiepedia:

John Coppinger played Graxol Kelvyyn
<https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Graxol_Kelvyyn/Legends> in *Star Wars*:
Episode I *The Phantom Menace*
<https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_I_The_Phantom_Menace>
 and Wookiee <https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wookiee/Legends> Senator
<https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Senator/Legends> Yarua
<https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yarua/Legends> in the same movie. He was
also the sculptor of Jabba the Hutt
<https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jabba_Desilijic_Tiure/Legends> in *Star
Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi
<https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_VI_Return_of_the_Jedi>*



Here is an interview with him:

https://starwarsinterviews.com/star-wars-crew/original-trilogy-star-wars-crew/john-coppinger-sculptor-jabba-the-hutt/



You can email John using the link at the bottom of his website:

www.johncoppinger.com



Yes, as William and I wrote in the 1996 paper you reference ‘a complete set
of tail vertebrae was cast in lightweight glass-reinforced plastic to aid
the mechanics of the tail mount. Parts of the main armature were also
strengthened to take account of the shift in balance now that the tail no
longer serves as an anchor’.

This matches my recollection well. I am fairly sure the rear legs were
removed temporarily to allow the metalwork to be altered to reflect the
change in the stresses on the armature that would result in the tail being
lifted – not to take the weight of the new tail (which was lightweight and
also had a support towards the rear) but because the tail acted as
stabilising anchor at the rear of the skeleton. I have a feeling that the
femurs were replaced with lighter replicas but I could be wrong about that.

Someone who should have a better memory of this would be Lorraine Cornish,
a senior conservator at the time and still in charge of the Palaeontology
Lab now (currently known as The Conservation centre). She has also been the
person overseeing the removal of the Diplodocus skeleton from the main
hall, then its conservation and its UK tour, plus its planned conversion
into a bronze replica, to be permanently sited outside in the revamped
museum gardens (I assume you know about this?....). Lorraine’s email
address is: lpc@nhm.ac.uk

You say ‘The dragging plaster casts of the original were replaced…. that
better reflects current understanding of sauropod behaviour, as well as
discouraging petty theft.’

[REDACTED]

You are welcome to Pers. Comm me on the other bits, if you feel you should,
if any of it is useful.



With best wishes, Nigel.

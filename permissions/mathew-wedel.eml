Uh, those are some rather large bones to not know the origins of.

Here's the thought that haunts me: in my never-published 4th dissertation
chapter, I used the femur length of D. carnegie along with the cervical and
dorsal lengths to do stats. I wonder how many other people have done the
same, not realizing to what extent that skeleton is a chimaera. That will
be a very good point to make in your paper on that mount, and you are
welcome to use my diss. as evidence of people misusing measurements of that
skeleton because they didn't know the complexities of its origin(s).

Best,

Matt

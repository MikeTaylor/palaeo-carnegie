Hi Mike,

Yes, it is rather abrupt at how quickly the morphological changes occur as you move backwards along the tail. I am unsure as to why caudal 38 was labeled A and B but suspect it had something to do with how it was originally mounted in 1907.  As I recall several Caudal vertebrae in the mid 50’s were fused together during fossilization process and this made the mounting of the tail especially difficult when making the tail curve. 

The Curatorial staff at the Carnegie and their advisers were responsible for identifying any elements of the skeleton which needed to be changed and where replacements could be obtained. I was unaware of Kirby Sieber’s appropriately sized fossil material so I cannot offer any insight as to why that material was not used. 

Of course you have my full permission to use the photo of Dippy taken in our Studio (IMGP1158.JPG)  and I am sending another image of Dippy (a full frontal) which you can also use if you choose (IMGP1184.JPG)

Please send me a copy of your paper upon completion as it is something I would enjoy reading. And the next time you visit Pittsburgh I would be happy to meet you at the Carnegie Museum and discuss the mount with you.

Regards,
Phil

I know that in the forelimbs of the remount as actually executed, you made sculptures based on the BYU elements. Do you recall why that option was chosen ahead of using Kirby Sieber's appropriately-sized real fossil material?

Of the caudal vertebrae in question 37-73  we have images of 37-46 taken right after disarticulation but before restoration and these images indicate this is fossil material. However, by caudal 46 you will notice it is a combination of mostly plaster with fossil fragment. I have no additional photographic documentation of caudals 47-73 but do have an excel spreadsheet of missing elements compiled by Carnegie Museum staff where Matt Lamanna notes “ total number of Caudals in CM 84 Etc. tail must be greater than or equal to 82". The spread sheet identifies Western Paleontological Laboratories as a source for acquiring the missing caudal vertebrae.  We are including this excel file in the individual emails.

I hope this information is useful and let me know if you have any questions about the images.

>> One of them concerns the caudal vertebrae of the diplodocine specimen CM 307. McIntosh's (1981) annotated catalogue of Carnegie dinosaurs says "the skeleton which was mounted and put on display in 1907 [...] was completed by additions from several other individuals as follows: [...] CM 307 (distal caudals)". And, giving more detail, Brian Curtice's (1996) Masters thesis says that Ca32 and Ca37–73 inclusive were from CM 307. He obtained this information either from Jack McIntosh or from materials found in the Carnegie library (pers. comm.)
>> 
>> However, there is some evidence that this may have only become true relatively recently. A note on the 2007 remounting located by Amy Henrici says “One caudal added from CM 94. Caudals 37–73 were casts in original mount and replaced with caudals from CM 307”. Henrici also found a “specimen removed” tag in the CM 307 drawer in collection indicating that the specimen was removed from the drawer for loan to Phil Fraley on 20 November 2006.
>> 
>> With all that said, my actual question: do you remember whether, when you were taking down the old mount before reposing it, the caudals in positions 37–73 were the real fossils, or casts?

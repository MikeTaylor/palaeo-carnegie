McIntosh (2005:68) gives the femur length of CM 662 as 1448 mm. As a cross-check, he also (p61) gives the humerus length as 910 mm (left) and 936 mm (right), and on the previous page gives the humerus:femur ratio as 0.64, implying femur lengths of 1422 mm (left) and 1463 mm (right). The given femur length falls close to the middle of this range. Hatcher (1901:47) gives the femur length of CM 84 as 1542 mm. On this basis, CM 662 is 94% as large as CM 84.

Subject: The restoration of the Diplodocus carnegii dinosaur cast of Mexico City

Dear René Hernandez-Rivera,

Linsly Church put me onto your 2018 Association of Materials and Methods abstract on remounting Mexico City's Carnegie Diplodocus. I was so pleased to see this, as information on that mount has been hard to come by. I am working with Linsley, Matt Lamana, Amy Henrici and Ilja Nieuwland on a nearly-finished paper about the various Carnegie Diplodocus casts, so this comes at a good time.

Did your abstract ever graduate to being a complete paper? If so, we'd love to read it.

If you have any photos of the current version of the mount, they would be very interesting for us to see — especially in the regions of the skull, the atlas (1st cervical), and the forefeet.

Many thanks,

Dr. Michael P. Taylor

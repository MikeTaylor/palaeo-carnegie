Subject: CM 94 caudal vertebrae loose in Carnegie Museum Big Bone Room

Hey Mike,
 
The other day, Amy (ccâ€™d) and I counted 21 partial to complete caudal vertebrae of CM 94 loose in the Big Bone Room here at the Carnegie Museum (Amy, please confirm that thatâ€™s what your notes say as well). Here are some quick phone photos of most. (Apologies, but I apparently forgot to snap a pic of the four or five mid-posterior caudals that are clustered together on a shelf near the north end of the Big Bone Room â€“ I can do so Tuesday if youâ€™d like, so please just let me know.)
 
Hope this helps a little! (Rather than further confuses things re: the CM 94 caudal series, as it likely does ðŸ˜‰.)

Cheers,
Matt

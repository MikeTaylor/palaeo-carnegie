Subject: New ViennaDip photos

Hi Mike,

I borrowed a camera and made some new photos. They are also not perfect,
the camera did struggle with the light conditions, but at least one can
actually see whats going on.

This should be the dropbox link:

If this does not work, I can send them to you as a zip or tar file.

Hope you find them useful, and best greetings from Vienna,

amadeus

You are very welcome again, it was real fun making them! (On the other hand these are sauropod vertebrae, so how could it not be fun?)

In case you want to use one of the photos in the paper, please do so, I'm absolutely fine with that.

And if there is anything else I can do, please tell. I have an annual card for the NHM that expires in August, so until then I have free access.

all the best,

amadeus

My real Name is Amadeus Kronheim (which sounds like a pseudonym anyway, "Amadeus from Vienna, haha, I see what you did there!") and I have no affiliations. So crediting it with my name would be fine. Please feel free to use the photos in any way you consider useful (including sharing, posting, whatever).

Just to be on the safe side: you can download them, don't you? I don't have to invite you or share the directory on dropbox with you?

And are you still interested in the history of the mount or do you have already what you need?

amadeus

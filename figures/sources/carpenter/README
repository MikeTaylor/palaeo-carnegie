Subject: Re: Diplodocus carnegii caudals

Hi Mike,
The Diplodocus caudal difference was highlighted in the unpublished manuscript with Jack McIntosh and Virginia Tidwell. As I told you before, those two dropped out and I was too busy as the new museum director to continue forwards on our review of Diplodocus. The attached is the figure in question from the manuscript. Now that I am retired, I am hoping to at least salvage the part on the Dinosaur National Monument Diplodocus (DMNH & USNM & CMNH material) as a new species (D. douglassi). I have three current projects that I need to complete first, so hope to get back to that Dippy project mid next year.

Ken

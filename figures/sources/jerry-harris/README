Hey, guess what I found? I forgot I had this photo in the sauropodomorphs PowerPoint for my Intro to Dinosaurs course:

This is clipped out of the PowerPoint, so it's not high-res, and I can't read the label at all zoomed in (too pixelated), but it's on my Diplodocus slide, and has the classic "Geology at Penn" scale bar, so it must be my photo! The second one from the bottom on the left matches one of the images in my 2006 paper; I'm not sure which one must be the other one from the paper, but it's probably one of these others taken from a different angle...? Or maybe there was more than one box in the drawer and it's from another box!
 
To answer Mike's question: it was so long ago that I don't have any specific memories of the location where this photo was taken, but I assume it was in the collections...certainly an ethafoam-lined box with a label like that probably wouldn't have been anywhere else...?

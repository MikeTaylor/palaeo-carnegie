Twtter private-message exchange with Verónica Díez Díaz

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verónica:
Hi Mike, good morning! I've already taken the photos, but I was alone and couldn't find a measuring tape.... so we need to take the measurements from the photos. I don't know if that would be enough for what you are looking for, but if you need more photos or something more accurate let me know, and I could try this week to have everything by next Monday (the only day that we can go into the exhibitions).

Kind regards :)

Mike:
These look great, and will certainly suffice for my present purposes. Many thanks!

Is your scalerbar 0.4 m or 0.5 m? (Its labelling could do with a bit of clarification!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verónica:
"Both". It is for photogrammetry, there are four points near the edges, if you take the larger ones then it is 0.5 m

They are these black doughnuts

The distance between the center of the larger doughnuts is 0.5m

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mike:
Wow, what a strange and complicated way to label a linear measure! Anyway, thanks for clarifying. So I make it that the whole scalebar is 0.6 m.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verónica:
Yep, I didn't have a normal scale nearby, and needed to use the one for photogrammetry :(


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mike:
PLEASE tell me you are making a photogrammetric model of the whole darned sauropod! :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verónica:
I wish!!! But Heinrich (Mallison) took the photos for making 3D models of all 3 sauropods at the MfN main hall. But I don't know if he finished processing them... We could ask him 😊

He even used stairs and elevators!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mike:
OK, that's exciting. I'm in touch with Heinrich from time to time, he will definitely let me know, triumphantly, if and when he successfully makes a model!

Hello Mike,

Here are the pics. Let me know if ok for you!
Just one thing : Ronan Allain, in charge of the specimen is currently out on a field trip, so I couldn't make the official demand for you. It normally won t be necessary, but if yes, I ll ask you to make the demand through MNHN platform (quick and easy to make), if requested in the coming weeks. But again, given that Dippy is in the Gallery, it probably won't be necessary. But I m not the one who decide! ðŸ™‚

Best regards 

Vincent

Hi Mike,

Paris' Dippy lenght : 23,5 m +-5 cm.

You can add an additional 80cm if the tail was off the ground, aligned with the sacrum.

Pic of the Atlas/Axis attached (best I can do).

Best

Vincent

Hi Mike,

My wife and I reviewed our photographic records of the remounting of Diplodocus and will send you a total of sixteen images. For the sake of clarity, we will send them as individual emails. Of the caudal vertebrae in question 37-73  we have images of 37-46 taken right after disarticulation but before restoration and these images indicate this is fossil material. However, by caudal 46 you will notice it is a combination of mostly plaster with fossil fragment. I have no additional photographic documentation of caudals 47-73 but do have an excel spreadsheet of missing elements compiled by Carnegie Museum staff where Matt Lamanna notes â€œ total number of Caudals in CM 84 Etc. tail must be greater than or equal to 82". The spread sheet identifies Western Paleontological Laboratories as a source for acquiring the missing caudal vertebrae.  We are including this excel file in the individual emails.

We are also sending images of the specimen during the mounting process and completely articulated in our studio before the armature was painted and the individual elements were shipped back to the Carnegie for installation.   I hope this information is useful and let me know if you have any questions about the images.

Regards,
Phil

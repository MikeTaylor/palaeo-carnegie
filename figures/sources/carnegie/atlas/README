Subject: RE: Atlas in mounted Diplodocus

Sorry Mike, meant to send this to you yesterday but Halloween pumpkin carving got in the way. Linsly (Church) and I both checked out the atlas of the Diplodocus mount last week and it looks sculpted to us. Here are some closeup pics so you can evaluate for yourself. Iâ€™m not knowledgeable enough re: sauropod atlantal morphology to know what taxon it may have been based on, but maybe you are!

Figure J. Several of the key players in the story of the Carnegie Diplodocus and its casts.
A. Andrew Carnegie, the millionaire philanthropist who funded the creation of the Carnegie Museum and after whom it is named.
B. William J. Holland, director of the Carnegie Museum, whom Carnegie tasked with sourcing a giant dinosaur to exhibit.
C. Olaf A. Peterson, who led the excavation of the paratype specimen CM 94. (See Figure K for those who excavated the holotype specimen CM 84).
D. Arthur S. Coggeshall, who was the lead preparator of the Diplodocus fossils and supervised the subsequent mounting of both the original material and the casts.
E. John B. Hatcher, who wrote the classic 1901 monograph describing the new species Diplodocus carnegii based on CM 84 and CM 94.
F. Serafino Agostini, leader of the Italian crew that made the plaster molds and sculpted some of the elements that these were taken from.

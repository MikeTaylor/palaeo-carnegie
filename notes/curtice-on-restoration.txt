When I visited the Carnegie material disassembled in NJ in ‘06 or so I was stunned to see how the guys that mounted them did the same thing to the dorsal verts on Apato and Diplo. They flat out sculpted large swaths of dorsals. I now wonder how much of the Carnegie plates were drawn pre-restoration despite the inclusion of cracks in the drawing. Tidwell and I kept being astounded at the amount of restoration present. Oh yeah, add to this the fact many mounters grind up ribs to sprinkle into their bones before painting to make them seem “real” and all of the sudden I don’t believe anything on a mount.

The amount of paste on these bones [cervical vertebrae of the Brontosaurus excelsus holotype YPM 1980] is incredible. The preparators showed me how it is as if they were restored twice, the second layer breaks off easily from the first. Chunks of bone are inserted seemingly at random. Peter speculates the preparators copied the shapes off of other sauropods.  There are literally sections of bone embedded in plaster with no rhyme or reason. Zags “in space” with no bone under them.  

If there were ever anything above the centrum on the cervical they are long gone. Much of the cervical ribs are restored, but there are enough original bone to get an overall sense. Nothing is complete though. 

The dorsals are in terrible shape. One has a spine that is “complete”, by that I mean there is a continuous bone from apex to centrum bottom, but it is almost entirely ensconced in plaster. They did a cunningly good job at making the exterior look like real bone, often adding in marks to roughen the texture. 

Caudals and appendicular are on the menu for today. I scouted the caudals yesterday and the spines and “wings” of the most proximal are mostly restoration at first blush until around 5. Will have more later!

Jack, Virginia, and myself were absolutely crushed to see the actual state of 3018 and 84+’s bones. The fact the father son team that prepared them straight up copied elements between them was horrifying. 

All at once, at least for me, I saw that the “classics” were of limited utility for taxonomy and that burgeoning cladistics would be scoring characters regardless of what was out there because what else could they do?  Existential crisis I suppose (plus kids, job change, etc.). 

I believe Jack and Virginia ran into their own buzzsaws of a sort. I don’t know if Virginia or Jack published anything after that trip.  

Lamanna was brand new in his job and not a sauropod lad. We three should have published something, anything but emotionally I think we were done. And politically there were things to consider, as there are for YPM 1980 today.

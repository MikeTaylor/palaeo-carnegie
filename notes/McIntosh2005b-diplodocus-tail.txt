Subject: Diplodocus tail

Dear Matt:
           When the Diplodocus skeleton was prepared and mounted by Coggeshall under Hatcher and later Holland's direction, the articulated skeleton CM 84 was used with missing parts from other individuals largely CM 94. Caudals 1 to 12 were taken from CM 84 and the rest of the tail was completed from CM 94 and another individual.
           If you have time you can do me a very great favor by checking which of the caudals nos. 13 to 31 and 33 to 36 are real and which are plaster. Holland stated that these were taken from CM 94 and implied that all 23 of these caudals were real, but this cannot be true. Hatcher in his Diplodocus monograph (1901) listed among the bones of CM 94 20 caudals and 11 vertebrae not yet well enough prepared to be identified. One of these (field no. 5) was subsequently identified as a cervical but the other 10 are probably all caudals. However, this leaves a total of at most 30 caudals of CM 94. Accession records and quarry maps identify field numbers 1, 6, 9, 10,21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33, 33', 34, 47, 51, 62, 68, 71, 72, 73, 76, 77, 79 as caudals  and field numbers 11, 27, 28, 60, 61 as not yet determined vertebrae (now assumed to be caudals).
           When I was studying the collection in 1969 I found on the shelves 17 caudals marked CM 94 which had not been used in the mount.
Subsequently in the early 1970's Wann Langston returned to Pittsburgh
6 more caudals of CM 94 which had been sent to Cleveland (and later
Houston) to fill out the Diplodpocus hayi skeleton which had been bought by Cleveland. (Wann cast these for his mount and returned the originals to Pittsburgh, reasoning quite rightly , that this important specimen should not be divided.) This means that there are
17+6=23 caudals of Cm 94 not used in the Pittsburgh mount.If Holland
were correct that 23 other caudals had been used , that would mean that the total number of CM94 caudals would be 23+23=46 instead of the 30 or 31 as known from field records and Hatcher's report.I suspect that Coggeshall selected some of the better preserved caudals of CM 94 and molded those in between. I tried to determine which of these were plaster and came up with 7 (too few) which seemed to me might well be plaster, but without scratching the bones it was vcery difficult to tell for sure. It occurs to me that this time when the exhibits are closed would be the ideal time to determine for sure which caudals are real and which of 15 or 16 are plaster. The two pairs of fused caudals 20-21 and 24-25 are certainly real.
           Hatcher commented that an extra pair of ischia among the CM
94 bones showed that a second individual was present inCM 94. There are also an extra pubis and partial femur. It is also clear that there are two tails represented in the CM 94 material, one significantly larger than the other. Could it possibly be part of CM
84 which had drifted up to mix in in with CM 94? Probably not, but the puzzle perplexes me.
           I know how busy you must be and likely do not have time to look into this, but I would be deeply grateful if you could do so.
I had hoped to get out your way this summer to do this myself but have been dogged with minor health problems. I still might make it if it is not too late to be of some help to you.

Sincerely yours, Jack

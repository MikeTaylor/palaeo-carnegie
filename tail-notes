In the original mount, caudals 31 and 33-35 were plaster. (I'm not totally sure where I would've obtained this information, but I suspect it was from Ken Carpenter or Jack McIntosh.) If correct, that would imply that our historic sources (e.g., Holland 1906; McIntosh 1981; Curtice 1995) were in error (in stating that caudals 31 and 33-35 were real bones of CM 94), unless these plaster vertebrae were swapped in sometime after 1995. If we at the Carnegie traded out one of these plaster caudals (presumably based on CM 94) for a real one from this specimen, that could explain why the total number in the current mount is 83.

10 November 2005: "There are reportedly 23 caudals of the D. carnegii paratype CM 94 in the collection that were not used in the original mount.  I took a detailed look today and found 20 of them. Most are  from the base of the tail, and as such are not needed for the new mount (caudals 1-12 are from the holotype CM 84, and we have no desire to replace them).  However, eight of the vertebrae I found are from the middle or middle-distal section of the tail, and as such might potentially be incorporated into the new mount (in the original mount, caudals 31 and 33-35 [probably a typo for 36] are plaster."

Tom just clarified for me that vertebrae 20 and 21 and 24 and 25 are fused together.  So, we have the final list that Dr. Mcintosh requested:

The first 12 caudals were all real fossil material of CM 84. Of the 25 vertebrae (including both #32s) that made up the sequence from 13 to 36 inclusive, Lucas's examination showed that nine were plaster (13-16, 31-32A, 33-35). Note that one of the two vertebrae labelled #32 was bone and one was plaster: it is not clear which of these was the one from CM 307.

At this time, Amy Henrici was able to locate 11 or 12 caudals marked CM 94 in collection, in good condition, and the decision was made to incorporate some of this material into the remount. XXX contrast with McIntosh's expectations from earlier emails.

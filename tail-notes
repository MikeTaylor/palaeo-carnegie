In the original mount, caudals 31 and 33-35 were plaster. (I'm not totally sure where I would've obtained this information, but I suspect it was from Ken Carpenter or Jack McIntosh.) If correct, that would imply that our historic sources (e.g., Holland 1906; McIntosh 1981; Curtice 1995) were in error (in stating that caudals 31 and 33-35 were real bones of CM 94), unless these plaster vertebrae were swapped in sometime after 1995. If we at the Carnegie traded out one of these plaster caudals (presumably based on CM 94) for a real one from this specimen, that could explain why the total number in the current mount is 83.

10 November 2005: "There are reportedly 23 caudals of the D. carnegii paratype CM 94 in the collection that were not used in the original mount.  I took a detailed look today and found 20 of them. Most are  from the base of the tail, and as such are not needed for the new mount (caudals 1-12 are from the holotype CM 84, and we have no desire to replace them).  However, eight of the vertebrae I found are from the middle or middle-distal section of the tail, and as such might potentially be incorporated into the new mount (in the original mount, caudals 31 and 33-35 [probably a typo for 36] are plaster."

Tom just clarified for me that vertebrae 20 and 21 and 24 and 25 are fused together.  So, we have the final list that Dr. Mcintosh requested:

Holland's (1906:252-254) account of the caudal vertebrae that we cast to use in the London mount specifies that 73 caudals were used as follows: 1-12 from CM 84; 13-31 and 33-36 from CM 94; and 32 and 37-73 from CM 307. It has often been assumed that the corresponding real fossil vertebrae were used in the 1907 mount at the Carnegie Museum, but Holland never made this claim: indeed he could not have done so, as the mount was not executed until his account was published. The assumption that the real fossil caudals were used has appeared in the literature (e.g. Curtice 1996:73, Tschopp et al. 2019:20, and by implication even McIntosh 1981:20). In fact the situation was much more complicated, and careful examination of the demounted elements in July 2005 by Scott Lucas of Phil Fraley Productions showed that numerous plaster casts were used in place of fossil caudals, for reasons that are now obscure. To make matters more confusing still, the numbering of the vertebrae was erratic, with two vertebrae designated 32.

The first 12 caudals were all real fossil material of CM 84. Of the 25 vertebrae (including both #32s) that made up the sequence from 13 to 36 inclusive, Lucas's examination showed that nine were plaster (13-16, 31-32A, 33-35). Note that one of the two vertebrae labelled #32 was bone and one was plaster: it is not clear which of these was the one from CM 307.

At this time, Amy Henrici was able to locate 11 or 12 caudals marked CM 94 in collection, in good condition, and the decision was made to incorporate some of this material into the remount. XXX contrast with McIntosh's expectations from earlier emails.

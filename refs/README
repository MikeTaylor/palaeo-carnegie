Seneff, Jeannette F. 1947. Fossils are his business. Carnegie Magazine
21(4):117â€“119.

Note that the second photo in this article demonstrates that the CM
11161 skull replica was in place on our Dippy mount by 1947. (You can
see the sclerotic ring in the left orbit.)

"Fossils are Serafino Agostini's daily business. He came to Carnegie
Museum forty-three years ago to work on the giant Diplodocus
carnegiei".

If this can be trusted, then, he arrived in 1904 and D. carnegii was
his first job. The dates fit.

"At the time he had been working for eight years with a Pittsburgh
manufacturer of church statuary. He had come to this country from
Italy as a youth of fifteen."

So he came in 1896 and had been born in 1881

"Arthur Coggeshall, then laboratory head and now director of .he Santa
Barbara Museum of Natural History"

So that's what Coggeshall did next.

"He will retire early this next year and has been urged to rejoin the
statuary manufacturer, but hasn't yet made up his mind."

At the time of writing (1947) he would have been 66 years old, so
retiring at 67 does not seem unreasonable.

# Notes on Matt Lamanna's comments on Carnegie _Diplodocus_ manuscript

> Mike, up to you, but I might go with something a little more specific, since there are lots of Diplodocus specimens here at the Carnegie Museum, not just the mounted D. carnegii holotype and the other fossils that supplement it. Maybe something like, “The history and composition of the Diplodocus skeleton mounted at Carnegie Museum of Natural History” instead?

Having considered this, I take your point, but I've concluded that the present, punchier, title is better: yes, that are other Diplodocus specimens held at the Carnegie Museum, but it's not like anyone is going to be in any doubt about which is THE Carnegie Diplodocus — a term that's already in widespread use.

> Is it more appropriate to say “…had casts of this specimen made for museums in nine prominent cities…”? I ask because I don’t know whether Carnegie himself paid for the mounting of these casts or whether that cost (i.e., the mounting itself) was borne by the European and Latin American institutions in question.

In general Carnegie paid for the mounting, leaving it for local institutions to provide the wooden plinths on which the mounted skeletons would stand.

I ask because I don’t know whether Carnegie himself paid for the mounting of these casts or whether that cost (i.e., the mounting itself) was borne by the European and Latin American institutions in question.

I retained the original wording because Russia cannot really be considered part of Europe.

I have stayed with the term "forefoot" throughout as it pluralizes more clearly than "manus" and is no less explicit.

> Maybe add an “arguably” here? As much as I’d like to think that our beloved Dippy is the world’s most familiar or most famous dinosaur, there are others, such as SUE the T. rex, that might have a reasonable claim there…

I don't think so. Everyone knows _T_. _rex_ (or, rather, "T-Rex") but relatively few people know the names of individual specimens such as Sue or Stan. But everyone knows Dippy.

Thank you for catching the surviving Britishisms (e.g. verbs ending "-ise" instead of "-ize". I tried to write in American, but I suppose I am blind to a lot of the violations of that rubric.

Relatedly, thanks for catching the places where I missed Oxford commas.

I'm also grudgingly accepting your "correction" to the American style in which punctuation marks are inexplicably placed outside the quotes of which they are a part. It's so wrong, but I acknowledge that the journal will want it that way. We live in a fallen world.

> I’m mystified as to why I’ve never included CM 33985 in this list of component specimens too (i.e., why I always say “CM 84/94/307” instead of “CM 84/94/307/33985”). Maybe I’m implicitly trying to set a cut off at the relatively substantial specimens in the mount, and not including CM 33985 because it was just a partial distal hind limb? Who knows.

Only Matt Lamanna can tell us! :-)

> This museum is currently called the Houston Museum of Natural Science; I’m not sure if it was called the Houston Museum of Natural History back in 1963 when this sale was made, though. Assuming that was indeed the case, I’ve added a parenthetical statement in an attempt to clarify the situation.

No, I'm pretty sure this was just a mistake on my part. Thanks for catching it!

> Should we explicitly distinguish between casts and sculptures too?

I tried to do this, but found myself writing "A sculpture is distinguished from
a cast in that is is sculpted rather than cast"! So, no, I assumed people will not need this explained.

> The spelling of Peterson’s first name is unclear to me; it’s sometimes given as “Olaf” and other times as “Olof.” I get around the problem by just referring to him as “O. A.”

See the email thread with Ilja that I forwarded to you.

> I try not to mix the terms “proximal” and “distal” vs. “anterior” and “posterior” when discussing caudal vertebrae. I’ve made appropriate changes below as well.

Thank you. For some reason, this is a favourite mistake of mine.

>> renowned sauropod expert John S. McIntosh considered D. carnegii legitimately distinct from the type species, D. longus (Rea 2001:ix)

> And so does basically everyone else who studies diplodocids, I think.

Not quite, but I added "and this separation has been widely followed".

> FWIW, this specimen was regarded as referable to Apatosaurus ajax by Upchurch et al. (2004) and Apatosaurinae indet. by Tschopp et al. (2015) (not Brontosaurus).

Given the uncertainty surrounding this specimen (see https://svpow.com/2015/05/09/what-should-we-tell-people-about-the-amnh-apatosaurine/), I judged it best to go with the historic designation. It was certainly billed at _Brontosaurus_ at the time of the mounting.

> We seem to alternate back and forth between including the “th,” “nd,” “st,” etc. after dates (and not doing so). Maybe just leave these suffixes off throughout the manuscript? So, for example, this would be rewritten as “16 February 1905”?

I'm OK with that solution. Are we confident the Annals will be happy with that? The guidelines at https://carnegiemnh.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CMNH-PUBLICATIONS-AUTHORS-GUIDE-6-Jan-2010.pdf don't seem to mention it.
